The use of the grid as an ordering system is the expression of a certain mental attitude inasmuch as it shows the designer concieves his work in terms that are contructive and oriented to the future. This is the expression of a professional ethos: the designer's work should have the clearly intelligible, objective, function and aesthetic quality of mathematical thinking.

His work would thus be a contribution to general culture and itself form part of it.

Constructive design which is capable of analysis and reproduction can influence and enhance the taste of a society and the way it conceives forms and colours. Design which is objective, committed to the common weal, well composed and refined constitutes the basis of democratic behavior. Constructivist design means the conversion of design laws into practical solutions. Work done systematically and in accordance with the strict formal principles makes those demands for directness, intelligibility and the integratiion of all factors which are also vital in sociopolitical life.

Working with the grid system means submitting to laws of universal validity. The use of the grid system implies
- the will to systematize
- the will to penetrate to the essentials, to concentrate
- the will to cultivate objectivity instead of subjectivity
- the will to rationalize the creative and technical production processes
- the will to integrate elements of colour, form, and material
- the will to achieve architectural dominion over surface and space
- the will to adopt a positive, forward-looking attititude
- the recognition of the importance of education and the effect of work devised in a constructive and creative spirit.
